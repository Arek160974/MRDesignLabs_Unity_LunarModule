# Mixed Reality Design Labs

This repo is where Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality Design team publishes examples and explorations. The goal is to inspire creators and help them to build Mixed Reality experiences. We share sample app projects here that demonstrate how to use various types of common controls and patterns in Mixed Reality. Find out details about common controls and sample apps on https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design

Lunar Module is a open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs, it is a spiritual sequel to the 1979 Atari classic, *Lunar Lander*. This sample app will demonstrate how to extend Hololens' base gestures with two hand tracking and xbox controller input, reactive objects to surface mapping and plane finding, and simple menu systems. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experience.
